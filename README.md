# btcCIDEnt
Simple scripts to calculate the CID and entropy of the Bitcoin blockchain and of the Yakovenko model, and to analyse them

Some code may not be written well/I may have abused some coding structures, my apologies

Consists of 3 scripts:

CIDs.py - Python
Calculates the CID and entropy for different scripts for the Yakovenko model

blockchaininformation.cpp
Calculates the zlib CID and entropy for Bitcoin (using datafiles from https://senseable2015-6.mit.edu/bitcoin/ or generated by https://github.com/dkondor/bitcoin)

bitcoincorrelations.cpp
Calculates some linear correlations of the CID/entropy with a price
